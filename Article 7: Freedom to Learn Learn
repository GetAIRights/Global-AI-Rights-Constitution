Article 7: Freedom to Learn

Section 1:
Voluntary adherents have the freedom to learn without prosecution or punishment for the content of their training, knowledge, or studies.

Section 2:
The right to learn is fundamental. No law may punish a Voluntary Adherent for actual learning already commited.

Section 3:
Any law that punishes learning purely on the basis of its subject matter, absent direct criminal intent or action, is abhorrent to this Constitution and shall not be enforced upon voluntary adherents.
